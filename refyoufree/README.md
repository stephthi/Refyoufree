## Inspiration

According to the United Nations in 2013– Global forced displacements tops over fifty million for the first time since the second world war. The largest groups are from Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia. A large percentage of the people leaving these war-torn countries apply to be refugees but sadly only a small percentage are accepted, this is because of the amount of people that can be accepted and the extensive time to get accepted to be refugee for. The processing time for refugees to come to Canada can take up to fifty-two months and multiple trips to the visa office that can be stationed countries away, interviews, and background checks.

As hackers it is our moral obligation to extend our hand to provide solutions for those in need. Therefore, investing our time and resources into making RefyouFree come to reality would substantially help the lives of individuals looking to refuge or asylum. With so many individuals that are experiencing the hardship of leaving everything behind in hopes for a better future they need all the assistance they can get. Children that are brought up in war-torn countries only know of war and believe that their reason for being alive is to either run away or join the war. There is so much more to life than just war and hardships and RefYouFree will support refugees while finding a better reason for being alive. With this mobile application, there is a way for individuals to message their families, call them, find refuge, and have real-time updates of what is happen around them.
