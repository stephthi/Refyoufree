<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<div><h2>Am I eligible to claim refugee protection in Canada?</h3>
<p>Some people are not eligible to claim refugee protection in Canada.

Officers receiving your refugee claim will decide whether it is eligible for referral to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), an independent administrative tribunal that makes decisions on immigration and refugee matters. The IRB decides who is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.

Your refugee claim may not be eligible for referral to the IRB if:
<ul>
<li>You have been recognized as a Convention refugee by another country to which you can return;</li>
<li>You have already been granted protected person status in Canada;</li>
<li>You arrived via the Canada-United States border;</li>
<li>You are not admissible to Canada on security grounds, or because of criminal activity or human rights violations;</li>
<li>You made a previous refugee claim that was found to be ineligible for referral to the IRB;</li>
<li>You made a previous refugee claim that was rejected by the IRB; or</li>
<li>You abandoned or withdrew a previous refugee claim.</li>
</ul>
